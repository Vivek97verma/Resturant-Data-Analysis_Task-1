# Resturant-Data-Analysis_Task-1
In this project, I utilized Python to analyze a restaurant dataset to uncover key insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and operational performance. The analysis included identifying peak dining hours, popular menu items, and sales patterns, allowing for data-driven recommendations to optimize menu offerings and improve inventory management. The insights derived from this analysis aimed to enhance overall customer satisfaction and streamline restaurant operations.

Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and manipulation.
Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Key achievements:

Identified Peak Hours: Successfully pinpointed peak dining hours, enabling the restaurant to optimize staff scheduling and improve service efficiency during busy periods.

Popular Menu Items: Analyzed sales data to determine the most popular menu items, providing actionable insights for menu optimization and promotional strategies.

Sales Trends: Uncovered significant sales trends and patterns, aiding in inventory management and helping to forecast demand more accurately.

Customer Preferences: Gained insights into customer preferences and behavior, allowing for tailored marketing strategies and improved customer satisfaction.

Operational Recommendations: Provided data-driven recommendations that led to more efficient inventory management and better resource allocation, ultimately enhancing overall operational performance.

Visualization of Key Metrics: Created visualizations that effectively communicated key findings to stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making.
